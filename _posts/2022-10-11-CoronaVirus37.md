### A Neeeeewww Car!

Again, I lagged big time on updating the blog. I guess that's the theme of 2022. In my defense, September was particularly busy with my son starting Kindergarten and other parent-related things. One of the most exciting things that happened in September was the arrival of my new car! Way back in early March, I decided to put down an order for a Tesla Model 3. Given the high cost of gas, and just an overall desire to move to an electric vehicle, I decided to go for it. I wasn't the only one with this idea as it took nearly 7 months for my number to be called. It's one of the many big moves this family is doing in 2022. We're scheduled for solar energy installation (which also supports the new electric vehicle). We also took our big vacation earlier this year. So far, the car has been a ton of fun. It's still driving, it still has a steering wheel and pedals, but it _still_ feels like a whole new experience. It's the most "futuristic" thing I have experienced in the automotive realm. Next up, an Electrician will install a high current circuit for faster charging at home.

### Music Projects and Album Update

After wrapping up the album submission in late August, I guess the creative juices were still flowing. I ended up making another song with the M8 Tracker that I liked, so I added that to the album submission. That brought me up to a total of 9 tracks and about 35 minutes of run time. Not too shabby, I'd say. After that, I've been working with the record label to put the finishing touches on the whole thing. I changed a couple song titles, and the ordering of the songs a little bit. I also changed the album title to try to fit it more to the overall concept of the album. I won't share the song titles -- you'll have to wait until it's released -- but I will share the album title. Previously, I was working with the name "Autonomy & Agency", but "autonomy" didn't seem as much of an opposite to "agency". Thus, the title I have landed on is Arbitrary Agency. I think that captures the spirit of what I was thinking while creating the music. The last album-related item is seeing some preliminary album art put together by the label. I was asked to provide some art direction, and oooweee, I think they nailed it. I'm excited for this release to see the light of day. I'm proud of the effort/achievement.

### What Else Is New?

I have been taking a bit of a break from music making recently. There are a couple of reasons. The main one being that I think I need a break after a streak of really cranking out the tunes. The other reason is that I'm also working on reconfiguring and relocating my main gear setup. I considered several options, up to and including selling off a lot of my gear to really downsize and focus on a few things. However, the plan for now is to stick with what I have for at least a little while longer. I'm almost done with the process of moving my gear to share space on my work-from-home desk. Just in time too, as I'm starting to get the itch to work on new songs. The first focus will be using the M8 to sequence and control the small modular palette that I have. I had some time to do a quick test of that connectivity and I think it's going to be a lot of fun. I hope to report soon on this endeavor and everything else that's going on.
