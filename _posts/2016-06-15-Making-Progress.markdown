I just wanted to update with a new post to see if I am still doing this thing correctly. I did a lot of setup today in the terminal (and on the terminal), installing Python, Ruby, and Jekyll. For some reason, I keep forgetting how to update via git and the terminal. Though, if this works, then I'm doing something right. Tomorrow, I hope to do some more tweaking to my site, after I learn more about Jekyll. Until then, it's time to go to bed!

Update: well, I effed this update up pretty good. I think I managed to recover the issues, but this blog post didn't push to the server. I'm going to try again after including this paragraph (shows up as a change).
