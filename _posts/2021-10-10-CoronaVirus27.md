### ITEM! NEWS!

Back on September 14th, I got a message from the head of [Triplicate Records](https://triplicaterecords.bandcamp.com/). They invited me to release an album as part of the 2022 release schedule! This is the label where I landed a song on one of their compilation albums, which was recently released.

The news of making it on a compilation was reward enough for my modest hobby. Finding out they like my music enough to put out an album is just mind-blowing to me. I got a huge boost and I can't wait to start working on this project. Given how slow my process is, I can't sit back. At the same time, I don't want to put too much pressure on myself to produce, as that rarely ends well for anyone.

The first part of this project is that I want to document the process as much as I can. This is truly a situation where the journey outweighs the results, so I want to capture as much as I can of that journey. What better location than to take advantage of this blog to be that album-making journal. I hope to keep the updates, however big or small, coming out regularly.

### Album Release Post #1

I want to aim for 6 to 8 tracks of new material. One thing I'm not certain of is whether I need to nail down a theme or genre before starting, or to just let the music flow and see how it comes together. I do think that my personal style has started to solidify over the past year, so perhaps I don't need to worry too much about selecting a genre. Make an album of me? I have some ideas brewing and now it's time to start putting "pen" to "paper"!
