### Forty

Yesterday was my birthday. The thirties are now in the rear view mirror. To be honest, I'm not that bothered by being forty. The older I get, the more comfortable I get with being me. I'm not worried about aging (much), losing my hair, or other things generally associated with being an aging man. There are way more important things in life. That's how I view things, at least.

A birthday in the time of covid-19 isolation is about as much fun as you would imagine. But, as with everything else right now, you just have to make the best of it. The day started off a little rough, but I kept a positive mental attitude [(PMA)](https://youtu.be/Ioxd6AcNfbQ) and climbed my way out of the funk to finish on a high note. The highlight was doing a video call with my (twin) brother and sister-in-law. That always helps cheer me up, and it definitely got me started on that path yesterday. I read some interesting articles recently and the common theme among them is staying focused on what is truly important in your life. We are in a rare (I hesitate to say unprecedented) time where just about everything has slowed to a standstill. We're afforded the chance to take a long look in the figurative and literal mirror, taking stock of everything in our lives. When isolation orders end, it will be all too tempting to return to what we considered "normal" life. However, maybe we should strive for "better" instead.
