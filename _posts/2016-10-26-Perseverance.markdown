Clearly, it's been a long time since I've written a blog post - nearly two full months! I hope I don't do that very often. Life has been busy lately, as is its habit. Fortunately, for the most part, it's a fun kind of busy. Still, I should try to push a new blog post up more frequently. At the very least, it's good practice for my git/markdown skills.
