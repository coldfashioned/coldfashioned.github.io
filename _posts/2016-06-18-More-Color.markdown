The basic [Jekyll][jekyll-home] template starts you out with a white background. It's great for starters, but it's too minimalist, even for my usual taste! I dug into the basic css file and found that the colors are defined using hex color assignments. I didn't even know that even existed - so I learned something else in working on this site/blog. After a web search on "hex color" I found a site that gave you hex values based on a color chosen from the familiar circular pallette chooser. I settled on this taupe-y color, since it's easy on the eyes and fairly neutral. I'm looking forward to digging into css more, and I hope to spruce this site up even more. Stay tuned! (seems like that's becoming my catchphrase...)
