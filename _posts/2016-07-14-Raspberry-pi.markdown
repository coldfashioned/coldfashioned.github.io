My wife has been looking to get an internet enabled temperature monitor. For the prices that we've seen so far, I knew there had to be a project out there using Raspberry Pi that would:<br>
<ul>
  <li>cost less</li>
  <li>be more fun to use</li>
  <li>be customizable</li>
  <li>provide a learning experience with RasPi & Programming</li>
</ul>
It didn't take long to find some projects, after some quick web searching. I am going to follow [this][instructable] Instructable project, since it touches just about every detail I was looking for in this project. I'll be able to view the live data on the internet, I can make charts of the data, I'll work with a LAMP stack, and of course - I'll get my first Pi project under my belt. I'm pretty excited, so I hope it all turns out as expected. Naturally, I'll keep you posted.
