### Vaxxed TF Up

As is usually the case with the pandemic life we've been living, it seems like a lot has happened since I last updated this blog. Or maybe not much has happened at all. Who knows? I have no idea. That being said, the biggest news (to me) is that I have now gotten both of my doses of the CoViD19 vaccine. I wasn't really starting to look for appointments, since I technically did not qualify yet. However, after getting a hot tip from my best friend, I booked a same-day appointment and haven't looked back. The first dose left me with little more than a sore arm & neck for a couple days. The second dose has led to more flu-like symptoms, but nothing too major. A little over 24 hours later, I feel mostly back to normal, albeit a little more fatigued/tired than usual.

### So... Now What?!

One would think that we could start considering safely approaching more activities now that we have achieved this milestone. Unfortunately, anxiety has a different idea. I'm going to be held back longer. It's annoying. I don't think I can do anything about it.

### Musical Update

If you check out the link above, you'll hear a compilation album put together by an internet friend I made on Instagram. He pulled together a handful of folks whose music he likes for this album. While taste is very subjective (hah!), who am I to complain. I had been working on this track for another submission I learned about on Instagram (more info on that soon) and decided it would work perfectly for this project as well. My day job was really busy at the time, so time was limited. Given the constraints, I am happy with how this tune came out. One of the artists involved also mastered all the tracks, so it is interesting to hear the differences in the final version.

After finishing that tune, I focused on another music project. Inspired by one of my favorite musician's live sets, I tried to create a similar style live set using elektron gear. This gave me a chance to learn a little more about the Analog Four that I recently acquired as well as the Octatrack, my current favorite music machine. I started out at 154 bpm, but moved up to 160 bpm along the way. It just _felt_ better at that speed. To be honest, I think I could move to an even faster bpm. There's room for experimentation, so that'll be fun. This one is still a work in progress. I hope to keep building on it, practicing, and learning more tricks to help make it a really dynamic, performable thing. That's the update on the fun stuff. I hope to have more soon.
