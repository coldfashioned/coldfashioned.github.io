### Momentum

The monotony is real. The strategy that I have been using was to simply look for ways to keep things fresh. What I found was that was taking a surprising amount of energy. It's yet another aspect of life in 2020 that contributes to the suck. I know we're all going through it, so I don't need to drill down and explain the myriad reasons why 2020 can go get bent. Lately, instead of trying to fight the monotony, I have been trying to embrace it. As strange as that may sound, I think it's actually working. The idea behind it is understanding that even though life isn't great, there are still **_so many things_** in my life that are worth celebrating. My family is (more or less) healthy and safe. This new approach has also paid dividends in dealing with our 3.5-year-old who has been really beating me up this year. I've had a solid couple weeks and I hope I can build on that toward a better future.

### Timing is Everything

Intuition. Seredipity. A hunch. Call it what you will, but few weeks ago, I decided to check out the internal job board at work. There were a few postings that warranted a click to read through the description. One, however, clearly stood out. I recognized the Manager as someone who seemed smart, yet approachable, which is now a priority when researching new jobs. The job, despite being a little out of my arena, sounded interesting -- something that could be a great stepping stone that gets me closer to my career goals. Without hesitating, I contacted the Manager about the position to express my interest and get a little more background. That initial conversation went well, so the next step was to polish a cover letter and revise my resume. I spent a couple days working on those items and it paid off! I applied to the job on a Friday and when I opened my email on Monday morning, there it was. I had landed an interview. So far, so good. Flash forward to today, the interview was two weeks ago, and I think it was one of my best interviews. I was a little rusty, and fell into my old habit of rambling a bit, but I still think I pulled myself together really well. At this point, I'm starting to approach the window when I should find out whether I won the position. Unfortunately, the hiring process where I work is notoriously slow, so I wasn't really expecting a response after only two weeks. All the same, I'm sure I'll start to get really itchy as the days start to add up next week. Given my roughly monthly blog updates, I'll no doubt have the answer by the time I get around to writing my next blog post. I hope I'll be writing about good news! Until then, send me ideas to distract me from fretting over the interview results!

### Coda

That's it for this post. I wish I had more, but that's all I got. I'm glad I was able to jam these few ideas out this week.
