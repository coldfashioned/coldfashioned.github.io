### Day 67

That would be 62 straight days with the children around 24/7. It's been a while since my last post / journal. I didn't think that would be the case. However, for a while, things were kinda shitty, then there was a low point, followed by an upward trend in the last week or so. Stress is a drag, and sometimes, it's really hard to prevent it from dragging you down. At this point, I'm just trying to hold on to anything positive to build on it. The littlest things can (and should) be celebrated.

I just hope there's no permanent damage to the family collective; and I hope we're all stronger for it when virus-related isolation is over.

### All Hail Octatrack

I have stolen moments here and there to tool around with my sampler, the venerable Elektron Octatrack. It never ceases to amaze me. I might even go so far as to say it's my favorite music-making device of all time. Whatever the idea, concept, or oddball project I decide to try, it has the tools to accomplish my goal. In the early days of learning its nuances, I felt more like I was merely suggesting a direction to go, with the machine maintaining most of the control. Now that I am getting more familiar with it, I think I'm wresting control from the circuits. Or -- even better -- perhaps the OT and I are merging, making mutual decisions as to how a project develops. OK, I'm getting weird. I'll see myself out now.

### Next time

Pseudo-milestone: I have now equaled last year's post count -- and it's only MAY! The littlest things shall be celebrated.
