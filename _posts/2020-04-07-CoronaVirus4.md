### Hurting

Today was a tough day. My three-year-old was being particularly difficult. He pushed me and pushed me, ultimately leading to me spanking him. It is the **worst** feeling I have had in a long time. It's not a tactic I ever wanted to employ, but I don't know what came over me. Everyone has a limit, and I guess I found mine. I must learn from this and get better. I don't want to do it again. The self-isolation required by this pandemic is taking its toll. My only hope is that things return to some semblance of "normal" whenever that can happen. For now, I am sad and hurting.
