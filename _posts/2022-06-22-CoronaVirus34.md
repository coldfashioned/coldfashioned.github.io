### Where is My Mind?

To say this year has been busy would be an understatement. I'm definitely way behind my blog post pace of last year. I'm OK with that, though, because it's a sign that I've been out there, living life. I should try to balance that with documenting all the stuff that's been going on. At any rate, I'll try to do a quick recap of the past **TWO MONTHS**.

### Visitors

Looking back, March was really the inflection point when my family and I started to feel fairly comfortable doing things back in the world without fear of Covid-19. That's not to say all caution was abandoned, just that we were ready to start living life again, taking measured steps in that direction. In April, things started to ramp up with my wife's brother and family visiting from out of town. We took some time off from work, went to a baseball game and enjoyed spending quality time with family we hadn't seen in a while. It was great.

### The Big Trip

That visit really gave us the courage to expand the proposed vacation trip to incorporate even more fun and family time. What began as a short trip to attend my 20-year college reunion quickly expanded to a visit in my hometown for a week, as well as an added flight to visit with my brother and his family for a week. The aforementioned reunion trip was sandwiched in the middle. We just returned from this trip and are settling back into the usual routine. It was fun, exhausting, exciting, expensive and fun. We had mostly good weather, which is quite amazing, considering the duration of the trip and where we spent our time. I think we only had 2 rainy days and a couple of really hot ones. The rest of the days were pleasant and nearly perfect. There's a lot to tell about this trip, but I'll have to save that for the next post.
