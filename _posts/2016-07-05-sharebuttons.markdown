Finally got a chance to do some reading up on how to customize my [Jekyll][jekyllrb] driven website. The change made this time around is subtle. I added share buttons to the bottom of the post layout. That way, every post that I write will have buttons to facilitate sharing to Twitter and Facebook. So, feel free to use them and share my content. I promise more exciting updates in the near future!
