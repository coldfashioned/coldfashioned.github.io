My lack of updating is a result of a (really) busy month of February. As I may have alluded to in previous posts, my wife and I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of our first born. February was mostly spent in the home stretch of preparing the house for his arrival, as well as with completing the kitchen updates.

Well, the best laid plans of mice and men... Our little guy arrived about 9 days earlier than his due date on the 23rd of Feb. We were able to get ourselves pretty well squared away with supplies, clothes and other baby needs. However, the kitchen is aaaaaaalmost done. The cabinets are painted and the kitchen looks great. The last piece of the puzzle is getting the backsplash installed. Fortunately, that's not a huge job, and we can work it into the schedule when we get a chance. It'll be nice when that's done, but I'm glad that we could get the painting done before baby.

I'm nearing the end of my first stint of paternity leave, and it's bittersweet. While it'll be good to get back to a few things at work (including pending job applications), I'm enjoying the time off to bond with the new guy. He is a never-ending source of inspiration, joy, wonder (and a little bit of frustration, hehe).
