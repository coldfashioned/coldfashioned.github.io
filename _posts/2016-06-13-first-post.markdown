Well. This is the first official post on my new website created using Jekyll, git, all with help and guidance from [Codecademy][Codecademy]. (Did the link work?) This website and first blog post signifies my start down the path of modern day coding / programming / whatever you want to call it. I know this blog post is really (I mean really) dry. At the moment, I'm trying to see if I can do this whole github workflow on my Macbook to start adding content to this website. Stay tuned!
