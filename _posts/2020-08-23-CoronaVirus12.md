### Easy Come, Easy Go

I'm writing this post later than I had hoped, so it might come across as disjointed. I'll do my best to keep the flow going. The focal point of this post is a vacation (staycation, I guess) that was torpedoed before it even happened. I was all set to have a week off from work with the kids in daycare. While travel or recreation is obviously out of the the realm of possibility right now, I was still looking forward to it. I started lining up various home improvement and other hobby projects to try and tackle throughout the week. But, on the Sunday afternoon prior, we got a call from our daycare center telling us that a positive Covid19 case came up with someone connected to the infant/toddler section. Those kiddos and siblings would have to stay home for two weeks of quarantine. That was a major gut-punch, and it ended up taking me about a week and a half to recover from that. I hate to say it, but that's the reality. Since my wife still had to work, the bulk of the family duties fell to me. Without getting too far into the details, the disruption in what was our routine proved to be difficult for all of us. It really threw my 3-1/2 year-old though. We have experienced some **major** meltdowns -- the likes of which we had not previously seen. Things are improving, but now I hope that the transition back to daycare doesn't throw a wrench in the works again. At least I am mentally prepared this time... _I think_.

### __THE__ Results

Our first task was to get the kids in for testing, and fortunately, the overall process was reasonably smooth. We secured a window to go to the drive-through testing center two days from the time we called (Monday morning). Even better, we didn't have to wait very long for the results. We found out the very next day, less than 24 hours later. Oh, and they both were negative, thank the gods. That was the best news I've heard in a long while.   

### Denouement

The solid week of insolence from my older child really wore me down. I experienced stubbornness and attitude like I never have. Given my current mental state of f***-COVID19-and-all-this-bullshit-that-is-this-messed-up-world-right-now, I was pretty crushed and used up. Thankfully, I got some solid help from my family (wife and in-laws) this week, which has helped me rebound pretty well. I will recover, and I will be a better parent after this.
